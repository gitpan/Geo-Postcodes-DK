Updated postcodes
------------------
It is possible to update the postcodes yourself, but I do not recommend it.

1. Check if the postcodes are up to date:
   Go to "http://www.postdanmark.dk/iis/postnumre/services.asp".
   The postcodes are up to date if the date on the second line
   is older than the one given in the line after "##mkpostalinfo begin"
   in DK.pm

2. Fetch updated postcodes:
   Click on "Print-venlig version".

   Select "Alle typer" and click on the button.

   Save the source file (as 'Print_vis.html') in the "./bin"
   directory.

3. Update the postcodes:
   Give the command "./bin/mkpostalinfo".
   The old version of DK.pm is automatically renamed (with a trailing dot and
   a large numer). Check the new file, as errors can occur if the structure of
   the postcode file has changed.

   A new file "DK.pm" is generated, with updated postcodes.

3. Install the module:
   Give the command 'make test install'.

Note that the tests (in "make test") are hard coded for a few selected
postcodes, and can stop functioning if there are changes in one of them.
I recommend that you instead wait for a new and updated version of the
module.
