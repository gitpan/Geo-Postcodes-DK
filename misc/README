Updated postcodes
------------------
It is possible to update the postcodes yourself, but I do not recommend it.

1. Run the command './update_dk -update'. This will take care of everything.
   The old version of the module (DK.pm) is automatically renamed (with a
   trailing dot and a large numer).

2. Install the module, after running the tests; './Build test install' or
   'make test install'.


The postcode file can be found on <http://www.postdanmark.dk/iis/postnumre/services.asp>.
Click on "Download til adressekartotek" (after noting the date below it)
on the top of the page, and download the file 'postnr.xls'.
The direct link is <http://www.postdanmark.dk/iis/postnumre/postnr.xls>.

The syntax in the postcode file may change, and this may cause errors in the
parsing - and errors in the generated perl code. It is possible to check the
syntax by running the program as './update_dk'.

Note that the tests are hard coded for a few selected postcodes, and can stop
functioning if there are changes in one of them.  I recommend that you instead
wait for a new and updated official version of the module.
